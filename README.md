## About

Smol git repo for userscripts/styles I've made and cared enough to publish.

For a list of plugins/browsers supporting userscripts or userstyles, as well as
how to install one, check GreasyFork's
[Help Page](https://greasyfork.org/en/help), I personally use Tampermonkey and
Stylus on Chrome or Firefox.

## """Current""" Scripts and Styles

***If you have the plugin installed for it, the raw script/style links here should
be handled by your browser plugin as install links.***

### Styles

<details>
  <summary>ZyBooks Dark Mode</summary>

[**Install from GitHub**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caucow/Userscripts/main/zybooks/ZyBooks-DarkMode.user.css)

TL;DR I was tired of having my eyes assaulted by the blinding light of a
thousand suns when all I wanted to do was learn code.

This adds a dark theme to ZyBooks learn-to-do-stuff pages as well as
highlighting and setting monotype fonts for elements that contain (or are likely
to contain) code.

This isn't a complete dark theme, there will be missing elements I haven't
encountered yet and there are some elements (especially colored code and
animations) that don't have specific enough identifiers to select with CSS
and/or are colored by an element style rather than a class and would be (effort)
to change.
